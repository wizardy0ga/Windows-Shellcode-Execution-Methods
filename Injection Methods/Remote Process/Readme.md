## Remote Process Shellcode Execution

Executing shellcode in a remote process refers to the practice of executing arbitrary code in the address space of another process.

This is an evasive measure which attempts to blend the activity of the shellcode in with another process. A common target for injection are internet browsers since the network traffic can blend in better with benign network activity.
